# Firestore Learning Resources

An incomplete list of resources for learning Firestore and Google Cloud Functions. If you spot any errors or descrepncies (or have any other links to add!) please feel free to make a PR! ðŸ¤—

## Google Documentation

- https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/

## Video courses

### AngularFirebase

$20/m - I think all of these are at least free to watch. Some you need to pay to get the source code. There are many more in addition to these. Anything on this site is great.

- [Testing Firestore w/ Jest](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/testing-cloud-functions-in-firebase/)
- [Testing Firestore Security Rules With the Emulator](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/testing-firestore-security-rules-with-the-emulator/)
- [Join Collections in Firestore](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/firestore-joins-similar-to-sql/)
- [Model Relational Data in Firestore NoSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm66TSlVtcc&t=56s)
- [Faster Firestore via Data Aggregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Q5VM1ao2k)
- [Firestore Security Rules Guide](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/firestore-security-rules-guide/)
- [How to Manage Costs in Firebase](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/managing-firebase-costs/)

### YouTube

I'm sure there is plenty here but the The Firebase Database For SQL Developers cleared up a good deal for me

- [SQL Databases and the Firebase Database - The Firebase Database For SQL Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WacqhiI-g_o&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLlP-k-RKFa7RyNPa9_wCH2s) (8 vids total)

### Frontend Masters

$40/m. Not 1-to-1 with the DigiPops stack since it's Firebase and not Firestore but definitely helpful in getting up and running on queries and the front end.
